## Features

### Students

- AI chat panel on problem pages with real-time streaming (SSE) and LaTeX rendering
- Choose question type: **Understand** / **Approach** / **Debug** / **Optimize** (AC-only)
- Multi-turn conversations with history; select confusing text for instant clarification
- View personalized AI learning summaries on scoreboard pages

### Teachers

- **Teaching Analysis** — class-level insights from collective submission data, helping teachers discover teaching problems and take action
  - 8-dimension rule-engine analysis: common errors, comprehension gaps, learning strategies, at-risk students, difficulty anomalies, progress trends, cognitive paths, AI tutoring effectiveness
  - Error signature clustering: groups similar compile/runtime errors across students to surface shared misconceptions
  - Temporal behavior patterns: classifies students into 5 patterns (strategic solver, disengaged, burst-then-quit, stuck-silent, persistent learner)
  - Cross-dimensional correlation: detects compound risk patterns (e.g., high AI usage + low AC rate)
  - Code fill-in exercises: auto-generates blanked-code exercises from AC submissions for targeted practice
  - LLM-powered actionable suggestions with priority framework (P0/P1/P2) — specific classroom actions, not generic advice
  - 60/40 split layout with sticky AI suggestion sidebar, skeleton loading, confidence badges
- **Batch AI Summary** — one-click personalized learning summaries for all students on scoreboard pages
  - Longitudinal student history tracking: records error trends, struggle indicators, and actionable advice across assignments
  - Smart submission sampling based on milestones (first submit, first AC, score improvements, status changes)
  - Supplemental generation for late-arriving students without regenerating existing summaries
  - Draft/publish workflow with real-time SSE progress, stop/continue/retry controls
- **AI Test Data Generation (Beta)** — generate a full test data set from the Markdown statement on the problem files page (`/p/:pid/files`)
  - Supports traditional problems and LeetCode-style function problems (incl. linked-list problems via class or plain-list implementations); generates `template.py` / `template.java` / `template.cc` and `compile.sh`
  - Fill-in-the-blank (complete-the-code) problems: auto-detects scaffold code in the statement (manual override available); reference solution and test outputs strictly match the scaffold's print format
  - Paste an existing reference solution to make it the single source of truth for all test outputs; it is written alongside as the std file
  - Adjustable data scale (small/medium/large); cases must cover statement samples and a boundary group (min scale, scale limits, special values, special structures), each labeled with its intent
  - `config.yaml` judge config (`user_extra_files` / `subtasks` / `langs`) is built deterministically by the plugin; judge settings sync automatically once written
  - Ships a reference solution; every file is previewed, editable and opt-in before writing, with explicit overwrite warnings
  - Same permission model as Hydro problem file management (problem owner or problem-edit permission) — inaccessible to students
- Browse student conversations with filters (time / problem / class / student / userId)
- Autocomplete search for class and problem filters
- Multi-dimensional effectiveness metrics and question-type distribution
- CSV export with optional anonymization and metrics columns

### Admins

- Unified portal: Conversations / Analytics / Configuration tabs
- Multi-endpoint API management with model auto-discovery, drag-to-reorder priority, and automatic failover
- Per-scenario model assignment: dedicate different models to student chat / learning summary / teaching analysis, falling back to the global chain when unset
- Cost control: token usage tracking, budget limits, cost dashboard
- Rate limiting, custom system prompt, one-click plugin update

<details>
<summary><b>Security</b></summary>

- Multi-layer jailbreak detection (input / prompt / output) with cross-turn protection
- CSRF token validation, SSRF prevention, AES-256-GCM encrypted API key storage
- Paginated jailbreak audit logs

</details>

## Installation

```bash
# Clone (choose one)
git clone https://github.com/AltureT/hydro-ai-helper.git   # GitHub
git clone https://gitee.com/alture/hydro-ai-helper.git      # Gitee (mirror)

cd hydro-ai-helper
npm install
npm run build:plugin

# Install into HydroOJ
hydrooj addon add /path/to/hydro-ai-helper
pm2 restart hydrooj
```

Verify: visit `/ai-helper/hello` — a JSON response means success.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 characters) to encrypt API keys:

```bash
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-32-character-secret-key!!!"
```

Generate a random key: `openssl rand -base64 24 | head -c 32`

**Update channel** (optional): the in-app one-click/overwrite update follows `AI_HELPER_UPDATE_CHANNEL`:

- `stable` (default) — updates only to official releases (`git tag vX.Y.Z`), GPG-verified. Recommended for all real-user servers.
- `edge` — tracks the latest `main` branch code. Set this **only on your own test server**; do not set it on users' servers.

```bash
export AI_HELPER_UPDATE_CHANNEL=edge   # test server only
```

### Admin Setup

Go to **Control Panel → AI Assistant** (`/ai-helper`) → "AI Configuration" tab:

1. **Add API endpoints** — endpoint name, API Base URL, API Key → click "Fetch Models"
2. **Select models & priority** — pick models, drag to reorder; failover is automatic
3. **Adjust settings** — rate limit (default 5/min/user), custom system prompt
4. **Test & save** — "Test Connection" to verify, then save

## Telemetry & Privacy

Collects **anonymous statistics** (installation count, active users, conversations, version) for GitHub badges and development.

- Fully anonymous (random UUID, no PII); domain IDs are SHA-256 hashed
- No code, conversations, or personal data; auto-cleanup after 90 days

<details>
<summary><b>Disable telemetry</b></summary>

```javascript
use your_hydro_db
db.ai_plugin_install.updateOne(
  { _id: 'install' },
  { $set: { telemetryEnabled: false } }
)
```
